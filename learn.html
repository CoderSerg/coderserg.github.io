      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Cybersecurity is about protecting computers, phones, servers, and networks from attacks.
          Instead of thinking "my device just works", cybersecurity forces you to ask "what could break this?"
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Good security is a mix of technology (firewalls, encryption, updates), people (not falling for scams),
          and processes (backups, policies, rules). If any of those are weak, attackers get an opening.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          In this course you'll see both sides: how attacks work at a high level and how to defend against them,
          plus how Linux and coding fit into all of it.
        </p>
      `
    },
    2: {
      title: "Lesson 2 — Types of Cyber Attacks",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          There are many kinds of attacks, but a few categories show up over and over again:
          malware, social engineering, web attacks, network attacks, and account takeovers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Malware is software designed to harm or spy. Social engineering targets the human brain:
          phishing emails, fake login pages, "tech support" scammers, and so on. Web attacks try
          to break websites by abusing how input is handled.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          As you go through the lessons, try to classify each example: "Is this hitting the human,
          the software, or the network?" That mindset is exactly how defenders think.
        </p>
      `

    3: {
      title: "Lesson 3 — Malware Basics",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Malware includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and more. Each type has
          the same core idea: run code on a system without the user really wanting it there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          A virus usually attaches to another program or file. A worm spreads on its own across
          networks. Trojans pretend to be helpful apps but hide bad behavior. Ransomware encrypts
          files and demands payment to unlock them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Modern operating systems, browsers, and antivirus tools are all built with malware in mind.
          As you learn more, you'll see that writing malware is much less interesting than
          learning to spot and block it.
        </p>
      `
    },    4: {
      title: "Lesson 4 — Social Engineering & Phishing",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Social engineering is hacking people instead of machines. If an attacker can convince you
          to share your password, click a link, or run a program, they don't need a fancy exploit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Phishing emails and fake login pages are a classic example. They often copy the design of
          popular sites and pressure you with messages like "your account will be closed in 24 hours".
          The goal is to make you panic and act quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Defending against this is mostly about habits: check the URL, be suspicious of "urgent"
          messages, and never type your password into a page you reached from a random link.
        </p>
      `
    },
    5: {
      title: "Lesson 5 — Passwords & Authentication",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Passwords are still everywhere, even though they aren't perfect. Attackers try to guess
          weak passwords, reuse leaked ones, or steal them with phishing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Good defense means using long, unique passwords for each site, ideally stored in a password
          manager. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds another layer: even if a password leaks, a code
          from your phone is still required.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          As you learn more about security, you'll see other options like hardware keys and passkeys.
          For now, the main idea is simple: one password should not unlock your entire digital life.
        </p>

      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          When devices talk to each other, they do it over a network using IP addresses. You can think
          of an IP as a street address for computers. Data is broken into small packets that move from
          router to router until they reach the destination.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Most attacks that happen "over the internet" are really just packets with specific data that
          trigger bugs, misconfigurations, or weak settings. Understanding networks helps you see
          where firewalls, VPNs, and monitoring tools fit in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Later, when you explore tools like ping, traceroute, or network scanners inside your Linux lab,
          you'll be looking directly at how machines find and talk to each other.

      title: "Lesson 7 — What is Ethical Hacking?",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Ethical hacking is using hacking skills for defense, not for chaos. Ethical hackers look
          for weaknesses so they can be fixed before real attackers find them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The most important rule is permission. Testing systems you don't own or control is not
          ethical hacking — it's just hacking. Real professionals always work with written agreements,
          clear scopes, and strict rules.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          In this course we stay on the safe side: your own lab, your own machines, and public

      title: "Lesson 8 — Setting Up a Safe Lab (Linux)",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Before experimenting with security tools, it's best to have a safe playground: a lab that
          you can break without hurting anything important. The easiest way is to use a virtual
          machine (VM) instead of installing Linux directly on your main computer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          You'll need: a computer with enough RAM and disk space, a virtualization app
          (like VirtualBox or similar), and a Linux ISO image from a trusted distribution's
          official website. Download the ISO, create a new VM, and attach the ISO as the
          "virtual disc" to boot from.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Inside the VM you can install Linux by following the on-screen installer. When it asks
          about disks, choose the virtual disk, not your real one. Because the VM is just a file,
          you can make snapshots or delete it if something breaks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Once the VM is running, you have a safe place to practice commands, install tools, and
          explore security concepts without touching your main operating system.
        </p>
      `

    9: {
      title: "Lesson 9 — Linux Terminal Basics",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The terminal is where Linux really shines. Instead of clicking through windows,
          you type commands that tell the system exactly what to do.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          A few core commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800/80 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-4 text-sm text-gray-200 mb-4 overflow-x-auto">ls         # list files
pwd        # print current directory
cd folder  # change directory
mkdir test # create a folder</pre>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Being comfortable in the terminal makes every later lesson easier. Most security tools
          and scripts you'll use are built with the command line in mind.
        </p>

      title: "Lesson 10 — Files & Permissions in Linux",
      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Linux tracks who owns each file and what they're allowed to do with it. The three basic
          actions are read, write, and execute — often shown as <code class="text-brand">r</code>, <code class="text-brand">w</code>,
          and <code class="text-brand">x</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Every file has permissions for three groups: the owner, the group, and others. Tools like
          <code class="text-brand">ls -l</code> show a long view that includes permissions, owner, and group for each item.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800/80 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-4 text-sm text-gray-200 mb-4 overflow-x-auto">ls -l
chmod 755 script.sh</pre>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Understanding permissions is key for security. Misconfigured permissions can allow other
          users on the system to read secrets or run files they shouldn't.

      body: `
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          When you open a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to a server, and the server
          replies with a response (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.). URLs, methods like GET/POST, and headers
          are all part of that conversation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          From a security view, HTTP is where a lot of interesting behavior happens: cookies store
          session data, forms send user input, and APIs move data between services.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Tools like browser devtools or command-line clients let you inspect these requests.

          sanitize that input. When it doesn't, attackers can inject data that changes how the page behaves.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of attack where untrusted input is treated as if it
          were part of the page's code. A secure site never directly trusts what users send; it escapes
          or filters the data before showing it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          As a beginner, you don't need to perform XSS attacks. It's enough to understand that "user
          input must be treated as dangerous" unless proven safe.

        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Many websites use SQL databases to store users, posts, and other data. If an app combines
          user input directly into SQL queries, attackers may be able to change what the database does.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          SQL injection (SQLi) is the name for that class of bug. Instead of seeing input as just
          data, the database treats parts of it as commands.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The correct defense is parameterized queries and strict input handling. Modern frameworks
          make this easier, but legacy apps and rushed projects sometimes still get it wrong.

          Even the best defenses can fail, so systems keep logs: records of logins, requests,
          errors, and important actions. When something weird happens, logs are the first place
          defenders look.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Good logging isn't just "turn everything on". Too little logging and you miss attacks,
          too much and you drown in noise. Security teams often send logs to a central place to
          search and alert on patterns.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          JavaScript runs in the browser and is great for understanding how front-end behavior
          works. Inspecting and writing small JS snippets can help you debug forms, test basic ideas,
          and understand client-side validation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The simplest example is just printing to the console. Open DevTools, go to the Console tab,
          and run:
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800/80 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-4 text-sm text-gray-200 mb-4 overflow-x-auto">console.log("hi");</pre>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          JavaScript can do much more, but even this tiny step teaches you that the browser is not
          a black box — you can inspect and interact with what it's doing.

          Python is insanely popular in security because it's easy to read and has tons of libraries.
          You can use it to automate boring tasks, parse logs, talk to APIs, or prototype tools.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          A tiny example:

          OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is about gathering information from public sources:
          search engines, social media, public records, and more. It's used in investigations,
          security assessments, and sometimes by attackers to plan attacks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          OSINT is powerful but also sensitive. Even though the data is public, you should still
          think about ethics and privacy. Just because you can find something doesn't mean you

          OPSEC (Operational Security) is a fancy way of saying "don't accidentally leak information

        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
